# UX Specification: Task Manager App

A complete example of a 6-pass UX specification following the prd-ux workflow.

---

## Pass 1: Mental Model

**Primary user intent:** Keep track of tasks and feel accomplished when completing them.

**Likely misconceptions:**
1. "Deleting a task means it's gone forever" → Reality: Tasks go to trash, recoverable for 30 days
2. "Due dates are just reminders" → Reality: Overdue tasks affect productivity score
3. "Projects are like folders" → Reality: A task can belong to multiple projects

**UX principles to reinforce:**
- Tasks are fluid, not permanent commitments (easy to reschedule, archive, delete)
- Completion is celebrated, not just checked off
- Organization is optional, not required (can use without projects)

**Terminology audit:**
| Term We Use | User Might Think | Clarification Needed |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| "Archive" | Deleted | "Archived tasks can be restored" |
| "Project" | Folder | Show multi-project badge |
| "Due date" | Optional reminder | Show overdue indicator |

---

## Pass 2: Information Architecture

**All user-visible concepts:**
- Tasks (the core unit)
- Projects (groupings of tasks)
- Labels (tags for filtering)
- Due dates (deadlines)
- Priority (importance levels)
- Comments (notes on tasks)
- Subtasks (nested tasks)
- Recurring (repeating tasks)
- Archive (completed/hidden tasks)
- Today view (tasks due today)
- Upcoming view (future tasks)
- Inbox (unsorted tasks)

**Grouped structure:**

### Task Management (Primary)
- Tasks: Primary — core interaction
- Subtasks: Secondary — power user feature
- Comments: Secondary — on task detail only

### Organization (Secondary)
- Projects: Primary — visible in sidebar
- Labels: Secondary — visible on filter menu
- Priority: Secondary — inline on task

### Time (Primary)
- Today view: Primary — default view
- Upcoming: Primary — sidebar nav
- Due dates: Primary — inline on task
- Recurring: Hidden — in task detail

### Archive (Hidden)
- Archive: Hidden — in menu
- Trash: Hidden — in settings

**Navigation structure:**
```
Sidebar:
├── Inbox (unsorted)
├── Today (due today)
├── Upcoming (next 7 days)
├── Projects
│   ├── Project A
│   └── Project B
└── Labels (collapsed)

Header:
├── Search
├── Add Task (+)
└── Profile
```

## Pass 3: Affordances

| Element | Action | Visual Signal | Touch Target |
|---------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Task row | Open detail | Hover highlight, pointer | Full row |
| Checkbox | Complete task | Circle → checkmark | 44x44px |
| Due date chip | Change date | Hover underline | Chip + 8px padding |
| Priority flag | Change priority | Color indicates level | 32x32px expanded |
| Add button (+) | Create new task | Filled circle, + icon | 56x56px |
| Project name | Navigate to project | Hover underline | Full text |
| Drag handle | Reorder task | ⋮⋮ icon, grab cursor | 24x44px |

**Affordance rules:**
- Circle = toggleable (checkbox, completion)
- Chip = editable inline (date, label)
- Text with underline on hover = navigation
- Icon button = action
- Drag handle visible = reorderable

**State indicators:**
| State | Visual Treatment |
|-------|------------------|
| Incomplete task | Empty circle, normal text |
| Complete task | Filled checkmark, strikethrough |
| Overdue | Red date chip |
| High priority | Red flag icon |
| Has subtasks | Chevron + count |
| Has comments | Comment icon + count |

---

## Pass 4: Cognitive Load

**Friction points:**

| Moment | Type | Current Friction | Simplification |
|--------|------|------------------|----------------|
| Creating task | Choice | Full form shown | Quick add (title only) |
| Setting due date | Choice | Calendar picker | Natural language "tomorrow" |
| Choosing project | Choice | All projects listed | Recent + search |
| Priority selection | Choice | 4 levels | Default to "none" |
| First-time use | Uncertainty | Empty state | Sample project |

**Defaults introduced:**
- Default view: Today
- Default priority: None
- Default project: Inbox (no project)
- Default due date: None

**Progressive disclosure:**
| Initially Hidden | Shown When |
|------------------|------------|
| Subtasks | Tap chevron |
| Comments | Open task detail |
| Labels | Open filter menu |
| Recurring options | Open task detail |
| Archive | Access via menu |

**Memory aids:**
- Persistent task count badges
- "Recently viewed" in search
- Last used project highlighted

---

## Pass 5: State Design

### Task List

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Empty | Illustration + "No tasks" | Nothing to do | Add task or browse projects |
| Loading | Skeleton rows | List loading | Wait |
| Has tasks | Task rows | Work to do | Interact with tasks |
| All complete | Celebration + "All done!" | Great job | Review completed |
| Error | Error banner | Failed to load | Retry |

### Task Creation

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Quick add open | Input focused | Can type task | Enter title |
| Typing | Text + suggestions | Can add details | Complete or expand |
| Saving | Spinner | Creating task | Wait |
| Success | Task in list + highlight | Task created | Continue |
| Error | Shake + error | Something failed | Fix and retry |

### Task Completion

| Stage | Visual | Duration | Next |
|-------|--------|----------|------|
| Tap checkbox | Circle fills | 100ms | Animate |
| Checkmark appears | ✓ draws | 200ms | Strikethrough |
| Text strikethrough | Line draws | 200ms | Celebrate |
| Celebration | Confetti (subtle) | 500ms | Fade/move |
| Move to complete | Slide/fade | 300ms | List updates |

---

## Pass 6: Flow Integrity

**Flow risks:**

| Risk | Location | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Accidental completion | Checkbox tap | Undo needed | 5s undo toast |
| Data loss on crash | Task entry | Lost work | Auto-save drafts |
| Wrong project assignment | New task | Misorganization | Confirm on blur |
| Missed overdue | Today view | Missed deadline | Badge + notification |
| Delete vs archive | Task menu | Unintended deletion | Confirm dialog |

**Visibility decisions:**

Must be visible always:
- Task count badges
- Current view name
- Add task button
- Navigation sidebar

Can be implied/hidden:
- Archive access
- Trash/deleted items
- Advanced filters
- Recurring settings
- Bulk operations

**UX constraints for visual phase:**
1. Checkbox must be minimum 44x44px touch target
2. Complete animation must not exceed 1 second total
3. Undo must be available for 5 seconds after completion
4. Quick add must not require more than 1 tap to open
5. Overdue indicator must be visible without hovering

## Handoff Notes

**For mockup tools (Stitch/Figma):**
1. Start with Today view (default)
2. Include all 5 task row states
3. Show quick add expanded and collapsed
4. Demonstrate completion animation frames
5. Include empty state with onboarding

**For development:**
1. Checkbox requires 44px touch target despite 20px visual
2. Completion animation is not optional (core UX)
3. Undo toast must persist for 5s and be dismissable
4. Auto-save drafts to localStorage during quick add
