## In flight

- **Orders "After Dark"** (surface #3; branch `claude/orders-after-dark`). The order
  confirmation / **tracking** / detail screens. Chosen direction: the **Living
  delivery ritual** — tracking centerpiece is a rolling-digit ETA hero + a
  **Morning-Star journey rail** (Confirmed→Preparing→Out→Delivered, glowing current
  step) + a cream **living-receipt** order summary, with the live map as a framed,
  desktop-tier-gated companion. Shared `.orders-canvas` (warm light / espresso dark,
  doubled-class so it overrides the mobile info-sheet Drawer). Converts the plain
  pre-After-Dark palette (jade/charcoal/cream + raw-hex ETA ring) to hero/theme
  tokens. **All three screens done**: tracking ritual + order-detail page (split into
  `OrderDetailView` + reskin, resolving its >400-line warning) + confirmation polish
  (warm-paper summary/delivery cards). Theme-safe (cream cards = constant ink; canvas =
  theme-aware). Local verify green (lint · lint:css · format · typecheck · **1180
  tests** · build). Iterating on preview; awaiting owner merge go.

> **Next up after orders:** account → auth (per the customer-surfaces sequence). See
> [`customer-surfaces-after-dark.md`](./customer-surfaces-after-dark.md).

## Recently closed

- **#157** — Cart **"After Dark"** (customer-rollout surface #2). Warm cart canvas,
  photo-forward tactile line cards (bilingual, triad ledger-spine, swipe-to-remove),
  the **Morning-Star free-delivery journey** (replaced the truck/PartyPopper), a cream
  living-receipt summary mirroring `CheckoutSummaryV8`, + dish-sheet polish. Presentation
  only (totals untouched), theme-safe. **Merged** (`4dc3f4e`) — pre-merge adversarial
  review SHIP (one Low fixed: bilingual `lang` tag); landed via branch-protection bypass
  during the Actions quota pause.
- **#154** — Checkout **"After Dark"** (customer-rollout surface #1). Living
  **thermal-print receipt** (presentation-only totals), layered sheet-stack form +
  ledger spine, magnetic/ripple CTAs, maximal **rewards card** (Star-arc gauge +
  wax-seal coin + tier ladder on REAL `useRewardsSummary` data), referral offer
  below-fold + in-page share modal, bilingual wax-seal order-confirmation stamp,
  and the shared **`PhotoBandBackdrop`** (melded menu photo) reused on checkout /
  menu / homepage. **Merged** (`0706e7f`) — local-verified + adversarial review SHIP;
  landed via branch-protection bypass during the Actions quota pause.
- **#155** — Menu **top-region redesign** ("After Dark" v2, owner-driven, one
  branch): the stacked header+banners+tabs chrome collapses into a single pinned
  **`MenuRail`** toolbar (expand-on-tap search + scroll-spy `CategoryTabs` + live
  `RailCutoffChip` + Filters→`MenuFiltersSheet` bottom sheet); editorial
  scroll-away **masthead**; full-page **fixed photo backdrop** (`MenuPageAmbient`,
  transparent non-isolating `<main>` so it sits behind all content incl. the
  footer). **De-duplicated** against the global `AppHeader` (cart + ⌘K search
  live there — no more two-carts/two-searches). Rail pins below the header and
  slides in sync via `useHeaderVisibility`; scroll offset is rail-aware.
  **Pills:** active = **self-contained** `.menu-tab-active` gold→clay pill (bg +
  label on ONE element — root-fixes the recurring dark-on-dark active-tab bug the
  separately-measured indicator caused); inactive = **vellum ghost** pills.
  **Token audit:** `.menu-paper` over-photo chrome (favorite heart, modal close,
  add check) now uses theme-true non-remapped tokens; homepage/checkout
  **yellow-on-light** (`text-secondary` = `#ebcd00`) melds fixed. Cards: softened
  shadow, tilt disabled on desktop. **Merged** (bypassing the paused-Actions CI
  gate — locally green + passed an adversarial pre-merge review).
- **#150** — Menu & homepage **"After Dark"** epic (one branch, owner-driven):
  warm-paper theming + micro-interactions; photo-first **layered dish-sheet
  modal** (un-clipped close, single-scroll layered modifiers, live rolling
  total); **working dietary filters** (allergen-derived **fail-safe** +
  confirm-with-us disclaimer); owner-confirmed veg/vegan tags + **"Vegan on
  request"** toggle with a bilingual kitchen note; hero carousel opens the
  detail modal with warm-paper cards. **iOS hardening:** live WebGL map →
  desktop-only (fixes menu→homepage OOM); Modal/Drawer bottom sheets clear the
  status bar via `--sheet-max-h` (dvh + safe-area); swipe-to-close on public
  pages (`DomMaxProvider` on `PublicShell`); textarea no longer triggers iOS
  auto-zoom; rolling digits sit on the baseline. **Merged.** All pre-merge
  auto-review findings fixed (allergen safety, 500-char checkout-notes cap,
  CTA a11y).
- **#151** — `allergen-reviewed` tag (restores genuinely-plain dishes like Rice
  to free-from without claiming safety from absent data) + warm-paper-card
  favorite polish (`onPaper`) + **13 unit tests** on the allergen fail-safe
  path. **Merged.**
- **#152** — Full **allergen audit** from dish descriptions + owner kitchen
  corrections (DB + seed; 3 DB-only items reconciled into the seed). **Merged.**

- **#143** — Delivery map: device-tier gate (low/mid → animated static coverage
  map, desktop/high → live WebGL) to dodge the iOS WebGL OOM; warm-paper status
  bar + upper-center info chip. **Merged.**
- **#144** — Rewards offer banner: collapse-don't-vanish to a re-expandable pill
  (centered opacity crossfade; dropped `layout`/`popLayout` since public pages
  lack `domMax`). **Merged.**
- **#145** — Hero "Morning Star Rewards" → emoji-in-disc star **constellation**
  (arc + comet, magnetic nodes, tap-burst, reward/unlock-$ count-up, height-locked
  perk panel) + loyalty `jade`→**Diamond** display rename (id unchanged) unifying
  tier emojis to ⭐💎♦️👑 across hero/account/admin/emails; token-pure jewels
  (`--hero-ruby`/`--hero-gold`); JS loops pause offscreen via `useInView`.
  **Merged.** Six adversarial-review passes + a final subagent audit (verdict
  SHIP); all findings folded in (Diamond color in account+admin maps, focus
  announce, token purity, offscreen pause).
- **#146** — Claude auto-review on every PR push: `claude-pr-review.yml` workflow
  plus the review-calibration prompt. **Merged.**
- **#147** — Prettier-format the review prompt md (unblocked repo-wide
  `format:check`). **Merged.**
- **#148** — Collaborative iteration & merge protocol in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  (iterate on previews; adversarial review only just before merge; never
  self-merge; always read auto-review; mobile-first; framer-by-route). **Merged.**
- **#149** — `ensure-preview` CI safety net: forces a Vercel preview via the API
  when the GitHub→Vercel webhook drops a PR commit (non-blocking; needs
  `VERCEL_TOKEN`). **Merged.**

- **#127** — Migration-history squash _plan_ (docs). **Closed (superseded)** —
  the squash already shipped in the merged #126 baseline; the plan served its
  purpose.
- **#129** — Driver correctness fixes (route-start idempotency, stop-promotion
  fallback, idempotent re-submission, admin exception-resolve). **Merged.**
  Included the Resolve-dialog a11y fix (announced validation + char counter +
  de-duped SR heading).
- **#130** — Route-complete close-out + simple-mode completion fix (server-
  confirmed celebration, `RouteFinishingCard` hold, 409 premature-completion
  guard). **Merged** (rebased onto `main` past a squash-stack conflict).
- **#131** — Admin Delivery Day hub: single-screen command center + live fleet
  map (`/api/admin/ops/driver-locations`, date-aware ops infra, LA-tz helpers).
  **Merged** (rebased onto `main`; all review findings + the colorblind-marker
  Low folded in).
- **#132** — Customer world-class signature UX components (`CutoffCountdown`,
  `RewardRail`, `StarsBalance`) + countdown util/tests + Storybook, plus the
  cross-session PR-review workflow docs. **Merged.** Strategy: reusable
  component library — wire each piece only where it beats what's shipped
  (`StarsBalance`/`RewardRail` intentionally not wired; rewards hub + cart
  already cover them).
- **#133** — "Locked in" delivery ritual on order confirmation (`CutoffCountdown`
  `forceLocked`), with an LA-tz weekday fix on the existing card. **Merged.**
- **#134** — Workflow-discipline docs (own-session PR stewardship + stacked-PR
  merge mechanics). **Merged.**
