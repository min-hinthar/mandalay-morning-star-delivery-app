## In flight

_None._ The menu/homepage "After Dark" epic (**#150**), the allergen-reviewed +
favorite-polish follow-ups (**#151**), and the full allergen audit (**#152**)
have all landed on `main`. **Next up: extend the Anthropic "After Dark" UI/UX
to the remaining customer surfaces — checkout first.** See
[`customer-surfaces-after-dark.md`](./customer-surfaces-after-dark.md).

- **#150** — Menu & homepage **"After Dark"** epic (one branch, owner-driven):
  warm-paper theming + micro-interactions; photo-first **layered dish-sheet
  modal** (un-clipped close, single-scroll layered modifiers, live rolling
  total); **working dietary filters** (allergen-derived **fail-safe** +
  confirm-with-us disclaimer); owner-confirmed veg/vegan tags + **"Vegan on
  request"** toggle with a bilingual kitchen note; hero carousel opens the
  detail modal with warm-paper cards. **iOS hardening:** live WebGL map →
  desktop-only (fixes menu→homepage OOM); Modal/Drawer bottom sheets clear the
  status bar via `--sheet-max-h` (dvh + safe-area); swipe-to-close on public
  pages (`DomMaxProvider` on `PublicShell`); textarea no longer triggers iOS
  auto-zoom; rolling digits sit on the baseline. **Merged.** All pre-merge
  auto-review findings fixed (allergen safety, 500-char checkout-notes cap,
  CTA a11y).
- **#151** — `allergen-reviewed` tag (restores genuinely-plain dishes like Rice
  to free-from without claiming safety from absent data) + warm-paper-card
  favorite polish (`onPaper`) + **13 unit tests** on the allergen fail-safe
  path. **Merged.**
- **#152** — Full **allergen audit** from dish descriptions + owner kitchen
  corrections (DB + seed; 3 DB-only items reconciled into the seed). **Merged.**

- **#143** — Delivery map: device-tier gate (low/mid → animated static coverage
  map, desktop/high → live WebGL) to dodge the iOS WebGL OOM; warm-paper status
  bar + upper-center info chip. **Merged.**
- **#144** — Rewards offer banner: collapse-don't-vanish to a re-expandable pill
  (centered opacity crossfade; dropped `layout`/`popLayout` since public pages
  lack `domMax`). **Merged.**
- **#145** — Hero "Morning Star Rewards" → emoji-in-disc star **constellation**
  (arc + comet, magnetic nodes, tap-burst, reward/unlock-$ count-up, height-locked
  perk panel) + loyalty `jade`→**Diamond** display rename (id unchanged) unifying
  tier emojis to ⭐💎♦️👑 across hero/account/admin/emails; token-pure jewels
  (`--hero-ruby`/`--hero-gold`); JS loops pause offscreen via `useInView`.
  **Merged.** Six adversarial-review passes + a final subagent audit (verdict
  SHIP); all findings folded in (Diamond color in account+admin maps, focus
  announce, token purity, offscreen pause).
- **#146** — Claude auto-review on every PR push: `claude-pr-review.yml` workflow
  plus the review-calibration prompt. **Merged.**
- **#147** — Prettier-format the review prompt md (unblocked repo-wide
  `format:check`). **Merged.**
- **#148** — Collaborative iteration & merge protocol in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  (iterate on previews; adversarial review only just before merge; never
  self-merge; always read auto-review; mobile-first; framer-by-route). **Merged.**
- **#149** — `ensure-preview` CI safety net: forces a Vercel preview via the API
  when the GitHub→Vercel webhook drops a PR commit (non-blocking; needs
  `VERCEL_TOKEN`). **Merged.**

- **#127** — Migration-history squash _plan_ (docs). **Closed (superseded)** —
  the squash already shipped in the merged #126 baseline; the plan served its
  purpose.
- **#129** — Driver correctness fixes (route-start idempotency, stop-promotion
  fallback, idempotent re-submission, admin exception-resolve). **Merged.**
  Included the Resolve-dialog a11y fix (announced validation + char counter +
  de-duped SR heading).
- **#130** — Route-complete close-out + simple-mode completion fix (server-
  confirmed celebration, `RouteFinishingCard` hold, 409 premature-completion
  guard). **Merged** (rebased onto `main` past a squash-stack conflict).
- **#131** — Admin Delivery Day hub: single-screen command center + live fleet
  map (`/api/admin/ops/driver-locations`, date-aware ops infra, LA-tz helpers).
  **Merged** (rebased onto `main`; all review findings + the colorblind-marker
  Low folded in).
- **#132** — Customer world-class signature UX components (`CutoffCountdown`,
  `RewardRail`, `StarsBalance`) + countdown util/tests + Storybook, plus the
  cross-session PR-review workflow docs. **Merged.** Strategy: reusable
  component library — wire each piece only where it beats what's shipped
  (`StarsBalance`/`RewardRail` intentionally not wired; rewards hub + cart
  already cover them).
- **#133** — "Locked in" delivery ritual on order confirmation (`CutoffCountdown`
  `forceLocked`), with an LA-tz weekday fix on the existing card. **Merged.**
- **#134** — Workflow-discipline docs (own-session PR stewardship + stacked-PR
  merge mechanics). **Merged.**
