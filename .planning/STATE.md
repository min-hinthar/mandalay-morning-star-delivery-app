# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Every UI element is reliably clickable and the app feels delightfully alive with motion.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Production-Grade Launch MVP — Phase 91 in progress

## Current Position

Phase: 91 of 95 (Checkout & Payment Hardening) - IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1/4 completed
Status: Executing plan 91-01
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Checkout hardening foundation (DB, types, schema, utils)

Progress: [####░░░░░░] 43% (3/7 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 361 (across v1.0-v2.0)
- Average duration: ~15 min
- Total execution time: ~88 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Phase 91 Decisions
- Migration numbered 035 (033/034 taken by photo pipeline)
- Removed BUG-08 client-side price drift detection; 91-02 implements server-side approach
- Server-authoritative pricing: Zod schema strips basePriceCents/priceDeltaCents from client input
- totalCents clamped to Math.max(0) to prevent negative totals from large discounts
- Tip represented as Stripe line item; discounts via Stripe discounts param

### Phase 94 Decisions
- useState<Set<string>> for collapse state (not Radix Collapsible — overkill for toggle)
- Top-level Select All excludes collapsed windows for consistent UX
- Native sms: URI for driver SMS — no backend SMS service for MVP
- NavigationButton lat/lng made optional; falls back to encodeURIComponent(address)
- Photo enforcement is client-side only — no server-side gate on PATCH endpoint (offline sync safety)
- Offline-queued photo sets hasPhoto=true immediately (driver not blocked by connectivity)
- Extracted SimpleRouteDone to keep SimpleStopView under 400 lines

### Phase 90 Decisions
- Server-side sharp for WebP conversion (not client-side Canvas) — consistent output across devices
- 4:3 aspect ratio at 800x600 standardized for all menu photos
- Removed Google Drive URL from photo management — Supabase Storage is sole source
- Slug-based photo matching: filename minus extension = menu item slug
- Allergen dedup: removed redundant contains_* tags, canonical allergens_enum is single source
- Bulk upload threshold: >1 files triggers BulkUploadMatcher modal
- Photo seed only updates image_url when null or contains "fallback"

### Phase 89 Decisions
- Idempotency key uses only order ID (no attempt counter) — Stripe handles concurrent retries
- cleanupOrder is module-level function for reuse across checkout route
- RPC result validated with typeof/Array.isArray guards (no Zod, lightweight)
- modifierGroups parameter is optional for backward compatibility
- Refund uses calculate-then-apply pattern (no DB writes before ceiling validation)
- Debounce moved inside Zustand set() for atomicity; standalone function removed
- 10-second safety buffer only affects isPastCutoff, not UI countdown

### Pending Todos (Human Actions)

- Apply migrations 027-035 to production Supabase
- Configure RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var for svix webhook verification
- Provision Upstash Redis on Vercel Marketplace for production rate limiting
- Create Sentry alert rule "Rate Limit Spike" in Sentry Dashboard
- Verify timezone for customer gate: Asia/Yangon vs America/Los_Angeles

### Blockers/Concerns

- Upstash Redis provisioning needed via Vercel Marketplace before rate limiting is active in production
- Migrations 027-035 must be applied before deploying v2.0 features
