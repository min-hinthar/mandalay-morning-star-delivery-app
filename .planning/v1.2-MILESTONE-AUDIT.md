# v1.2 Milestone Audit: Playful UI Overhaul

**Audited:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Tech Debt (no blockers, 4 deferred requirements)

## Executive Summary

v1.2 Playful UI Overhaul is **substantially complete** with 44/48 requirements satisfied. Phase 17 (3D Hero Advanced) was intentionally skipped, deferring 4 advanced 3D features. All cross-phase integration verified. All E2E flows working.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status: PASSED**

### Verified Connections

| From | To | Integration |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Phase 23 (Header) | Phase 20 (Motion Tokens) | ✓ AppHeader uses spring, getHeaderTransition |
| Phase 18 (MenuItemCard) | Phase 19 (Homepage) | ✓ HomepageMenuSection renders cards |
| Phase 21 (Theme Toggle) | Phase 23 (Header) | ✓ ThemeToggle in desktop + mobile header |
| Phase 15 (zClass) | All overlays | ✓ 9 components use zClass tokens |
| Phase 20 (Motion) | All phases | ✓ 96 components import motion tokens |

### Hook Dependencies

| Hook | Exported | Consumed |
|------|----------|----------|
| useHeaderVisibility | ✓ | AppHeader |
| useCommandPalette | ✓ | AppHeader, SearchTrigger |
| useThemeTransition | ✓ | ThemeToggle |

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Homepage → Menu → Cart → Checkout
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

1. Homepage renders with HomepageMenuSection
2. UnifiedMenuItemCard opens ItemDetailSheetV8
3. Add to cart triggers CartDrawerV8
4. Checkout button routes to /checkout
5. CheckoutWizard completes order

### Flow 2: Theme Switching
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

- ThemeToggle in header works
- Circular reveal transition
- Dark mode CSS overrides apply
- 3D lighting adapts (if 3D visible)

### Flow 3: Command Palette Search
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

- Cmd/Ctrl+K opens palette
- Search filters menu items
- Selection navigates to item
- Recent searches persist

### Flow 4: Mobile Navigation
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

- Hamburger opens drawer
- Swipe-to-close gesture works
- Nav links stagger animate
- Route change closes drawer

## Tech Debt

### Phase 17: 3D Hero Advanced (Not Executed)

**Items:**
- Auto-rotation with momentum physics
- Food carousel with swipe navigation
- Physics-based drag momentum
- Particle effects on interaction

**Impact:** Low - core 3D functionality works, advanced features are polish

**Recommendation:** Execute Phase 17 in future milestone if 3D hero becomes homepage default

### Phase 16: 3D Hero Integration

**Items:**
- Hero3DSection built but not in homepage
- Homepage uses gradient/video fallback

**Impact:** None - design decision, not a defect

### Phase 23: Fly-to-Cart Animation

**Items:**
- registerBadgeRef not fully implemented
- Cart icon shakes but no flying particle

**Impact:** Low - cart feedback still works (bounce + shake)

## Verification Results

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| TypeScript | ✓ Passes |
| ESLint | ✓ Passes |
| Build | ✓ Passes |
| Tests | ✓ 343 passing |
| UAT Phase 19 | ✓ 12/12 |
| UAT Phase 23 | ✓ 24/24 |

## Recommendation

**Proceed with milestone completion.**

- 92% requirements satisfied
- No blockers
- All E2E flows working
- Tech debt is minor polish items

Phase 17 requirements (HERO3D-08 to 11) can be:
1. Moved to future milestone backlog
2. Executed as v1.2.1 patch if prioritized
