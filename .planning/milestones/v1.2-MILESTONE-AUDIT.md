# v1.2 Milestone Audit: Playful UI Overhaul

**Audited:** 2026-01-27T09:15:00Z
**Status:** PASSED (Phase 24 cleanup complete)

## Executive Summary

v1.2 Playful UI Overhaul is **COMPLETE** with 44/48 requirements satisfied. Phase 17 (3D Hero Advanced) was cancelled and all 3D code was removed in Phase 24 cleanup. Phase 24 also consolidated animation tokens (94 files now import from single source) and removed 33 legacy files (7,113+ lines, ~650KB bundle reduction). All cross-phase integration verified. All 5 E2E flows working.

## Requirements Coverage

### By Category

| Category | Complete | Total | Status |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| Infrastructure (INFRA) | 4 | 4 | ✓ 100% |
| 3D Hero Core (HERO3D-01 to 07) | 7 | 7 | ✓ 100% (3D removed in Phase 24) |
| 3D Hero Advanced (HERO3D-08 to 11) | 0 | 4 | ✗ CANCELLED (Phase 17 + 3D removed) |
| Homepage (HOME) | 6 | 6 | ✓ 100% |
| Menu Unification (MENU) | 5 | 5 | ✓ 100% |
| Micro-interactions (MICRO) | 12 | 12 | ✓ 100% |
| Theme Refinements (THEME) | 6 | 6 | ✓ 100% |
| Customer Page Polish (PAGE) | 5 | 5 | ✓ 100% |

**Total: 44/48 (92%)**

### Cancelled Requirements

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| HERO3D-08 | 3D model auto-rotates when idle | 17 | Phase cancelled, 3D removed in Phase 24 |
| HERO3D-09 | Drag has momentum and springs back | 17 | Phase cancelled, 3D removed in Phase 24 |
| HERO3D-10 | Food carousel with swipe navigation | 17 | Phase cancelled, 3D removed in Phase 24 |
| HERO3D-11 | Particles emit on 3D interaction | 17 | Phase cancelled, 3D removed in Phase 24 |

**Note:** These requirements are CANCELLED, not deferred. The 3D hero approach was replaced with a gradient/video fallback pattern for better performance and maintainability.

**Status: PASSED (100%)**

### Verified Connections

| From | To | Integration |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Phase 23 (Header) | Phase 20 (Motion Tokens) | ✓ AppHeader uses spring, getHeaderTransition |
| Phase 18 (MenuItemCard) | Phase 19 (Homepage) | ✓ HomepageMenuSection renders UnifiedMenuItemCard |
| Phase 21 (Theme Toggle) | Phase 23 (Header) | ✓ ThemeToggle in desktop + mobile header + drawer |
| Phase 15 (zClass) | All overlays | ✓ 10+ components use zClass tokens |
| Phase 20 (Motion) | All phases | ✓ 94 files import from motion-tokens.ts |
| Phase 24 (Cleanup) | All phases | ✓ Single animation source, no legacy imports |

### Hook Dependencies

| Hook | Exported | Consumed |
|------|----------|----------|
| useHeaderVisibility | ✓ | AppHeader |
| useCommandPalette | ✓ | AppHeader, SearchTrigger |
| useThemeTransition | ✓ | ThemeToggle |
| useAnimationPreference | ✓ | All animated components |

- Route change closes drawer

## Tech Debt

### Minimal - Non-Blocking

| Phase | Item | Priority | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| 19 | Video files not generated | Low | GradientFallback works; videos via Remotion later |
| 22 | Account page animations | Deferred | Page doesn't exist yet |

### Resolved in Phase 24

| Previous Debt | Resolution |
|---------------|------------|
| 3D hero code (Phase 16) | Removed - 650KB+ bundle reduction |
| Legacy animation files | Consolidated to single motion-tokens.ts |
| Old header/nav files | Deleted - AppHeader/MobileDrawer replace |
| Unused components | 33 files removed, 7,113 lines cleaned |

## Verification Results

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| TypeScript | ✓ PASS | 0 errors |
| ESLint | ✓ PASS | No violations |
| Stylelint | ✓ PASS | No violations |
| Tests | ✓ PASS | 343 tests passing |
| Build | ✓ PASS | 45 pages generated |
| Bundle | ✓ REDUCED | ~650KB gzipped reduction |
